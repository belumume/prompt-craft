# Contributing to Prompt Craft

We love your input! We want to make contributing to Prompt Craft as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the templates
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new templates
- Suggesting improvements

## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed templates, update the documentation.
4. Ensure your code follows our style guidelines.
5. Issue that pull request!

## Template Guidelines

When contributing new templates or modifying existing ones:

1. **Clarity**: Templates should be clear and well-documented
2. **Customization**: Include clear customization points with {PLACEHOLDERS}
3. **Examples**: Provide example implementations where possible
4. **Documentation**: Include usage instructions and best practices
5. **Format**: Follow markdown formatting conventions

## Template Structure

Each template should include:

1. Clear title and description
2. Purpose and intended use
3. Customization points
4. Implementation guidelines
5. Examples (where applicable)
6. Failure modes and prevention

## Pull Request Process

1. Update the README.md with details of changes if applicable
2. Update the documentation with details of any new templates
3. The PR will be merged once you have the sign-off of at least one maintainer

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using GitHub's [issue tracker](../../issues)

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](../../issues/new); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)
