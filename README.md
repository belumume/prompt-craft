# Prompt Craft

**The definitive collection of AI development prompts** - organized by domain, designed for scale, built for the community.

A comprehensive, systematically organized collection of high-quality prompts for AI-assisted software development that grows with your needs and the community.

## 🚀 **Quick Start**

### **Find Prompts by Your Current Need:**
- **🛠️ Starting a new project?** → [`prompts/development/project_planning/`](prompts/development/project_planning/)
- **🏗️ Working on existing code?** → [`prompts/development/architecture/`](prompts/development/architecture/)  
- **🤖 Setting up AI tools?** → [`prompts/ai_assistance/`](prompts/ai_assistance/)

### **Browse by Domain:**
1. **[Development](prompts/development/)** - Software development workflows and methodologies
2. **[AI Assistance](prompts/ai_assistance/)** - Tool-specific configurations and integration patterns

## 🗂️ **Domain-Based Organization**

This collection is organized by **problem domain** for maximum discoverability and scalability:

### 🛠️ **[Development](prompts/development/)**
**Comprehensive software development workflows**

- **[Architecture](prompts/development/architecture/)** - System design and architectural stewardship
  - [Stewardship Protocol](prompts/development/architecture/stewardship_protocol/) - Maintain architectural integrity
- **[Project Planning](prompts/development/project_planning/)** - Comprehensive project planning methodologies  
  - [Blueprint Generator](prompts/development/project_planning/blueprint_generator/) - AI-assisted project plans

### 🤖 **[AI Assistance](prompts/ai_assistance/)**
**Tool-specific configuration and optimization**

- **[Cursor](prompts/ai_assistance/cursor/)** - IDE integration and coding assistant rules
  - [User Rules](prompts/ai_assistance/cursor/user_rules/) - Expert-level AI assistant configuration

## 🎯 **What Makes This Collection Special**

### **🔍 Multiple Discovery Paths**
- **By Problem Domain** - Find prompts for the challenge you're facing
- **By Development Phase** - Project planning → Architecture → Implementation  
- **By Tool Integration** - Specific configurations for your AI development tools

### **📈 Designed for Growth**
- **Scalable taxonomy** - Works with 10 prompts or 1000+ prompts
- **Consistent patterns** - Same structure across all domains
- **Clear boundaries** - Each domain has distinct, non-overlapping concerns

### **🤝 Community-Driven Quality**
- **Standardized contribution patterns** - Easy to add high-quality content
- **Comprehensive documentation** - Every prompt thoroughly explained
- **Real-world examples** - Proven implementations from actual projects

## 🔧 **For Contributors**

### **Adding New Prompts**
1. **Use our [templates](templates/)** - Standardized scaffolding for consistency
2. **Follow the [contribution guide](docs/contribution_guide.md)** - Quality standards and process
3. **Choose the right domain** - Development, AI Assistance, or propose a new one

### **Quality Standards**
- **Immediately actionable** - Prompts that solve real problems
- **Thoroughly documented** - Clear usage instructions and examples
- **Well-integrated** - Works with existing collection patterns

## 📚 **Advanced Documentation**

- **[Domain Taxonomy](docs/taxonomy.md)** - Understanding the organization system

## 🌟 **Featured Prompts**

### **🏗️ For System Architecture**
**[Architectural Stewardship Protocol](prompts/development/architecture/stewardship_protocol/)** - Maintain architectural integrity when working on existing systems through systematic understanding and pattern preservation.

### **📊 For Project Planning**  
**[Blueprint Generator](prompts/development/project_planning/blueprint_generator/)** - Transform project ideas into comprehensive, executable plans using structured human-AI collaboration.

### **🤖 For AI Tool Configuration**
**[Cursor User Rules](prompts/ai_assistance/cursor/user_rules/)** - Configure Cursor IDE's AI assistant to behave like an expert senior engineer with systematic workflows.

## 🔄 **Integration Patterns**
