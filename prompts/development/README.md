# Development Domain Prompts

Comprehensive prompts for software development workflows, from initial planning to architectural implementation.

## 📋 **Available Categories**

### 🏗️ [Architecture](architecture/)
**System design and architectural guidance**
- **Stewardship Protocol** - Maintain architectural integrity in ongoing projects
- Comprehensive guides for preserving system patterns and boundaries
- Best practices for incremental development within existing architectures

### 📊 [Project Planning](project_planning/)
**Comprehensive project planning methodologies**  
- **Blueprint Generator** - Generate detailed, actionable project plans
- Expert AI-assisted project definition and roadmap creation
- "Vibecoding" human-AI collaboration methodologies

## 🎯 **When to Use Each Category**

### **Use Architecture when:**
- Working on an existing codebase
- Need to maintain architectural patterns
- Preventing architectural degradation
- Onboarding new developers to complex systems

### **Use Project Planning when:**
- Starting a new project from scratch
- Need comprehensive project documentation
- Want structured development methodologies
- Require detailed technical specifications

## 🔄 **Workflow Integration**

These prompts are designed to work together:

1. **Start with Project Planning** - Define your project structure and approach
2. **Apply Architecture principles** - Maintain quality as your project grows
3. **Iterate and improve** - Use both domains to evolve your development process

## 🚀 **Getting Started**

1. **New Project?** Start with [Project Planning/Blueprint Generator](project_planning/blueprint_generator/)
2. **Existing Project?** Use [Architecture/Stewardship Protocol](architecture/stewardship_protocol/)
3. **Need both?** Use Project Planning first, then apply Architecture principles

## 🤝 **Contributing to Development**

This domain welcomes contributions in:
- **Code review prompts** (coming soon)
- **Testing methodologies** (coming soon)  
- **Documentation strategies** (coming soon)
- **Security practices** (coming soon)

See our [contribution guide](../../docs/contribution_guide.md) for details on adding new development prompts.
