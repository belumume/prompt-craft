# Architecture Prompts

Comprehensive guides for maintaining architectural integrity and system design quality in software projects.

## üèóÔ∏è **Available Prompts**

### [Stewardship Protocol](stewardship_protocol/)
**Maintain architectural integrity in ongoing development**

A comprehensive framework for preserving system patterns, boundaries, and design principles when working on existing codebases.

**Key Features:**
- **Context building protocols** - Systematic approach to understanding existing systems
- **Pattern recognition frameworks** - Identify and preserve architectural patterns
- **Change assessment guidelines** - Evaluate modifications for architectural impact
- **Implementation checklists** - Ensure quality in every code change

**When to Use:**
- Joining an existing project team
- Onboarding new developers to complex systems  
- Preventing architectural degradation over time
- Maintaining consistency across development phases

## üéØ **Architecture Philosophy**

These prompts are built on key principles:

### **Preservation Over Reconstruction**
- Understand before changing
- Build upon existing patterns
- Avoid unnecessary restructuring

### **Systematic Understanding**
- Context synthesis protocols
- Pattern recognition frameworks
- Boundary identification methods

### **Quality Assurance**
- Pre-implementation validation
- During-development checks
- Post-implementation verification

## üöÄ **Getting Started with Architecture Prompts**

1. **Assess Your Situation**
   - New to existing codebase? ‚Üí Start with Stewardship Protocol
   - Need design guidance? ‚Üí Review pattern recognition sections
   - Planning changes? ‚Üí Use change assessment frameworks

2. **Follow the Protocols**
   - Begin with foundational understanding
   - Apply pattern recognition techniques
   - Use implementation checklists for quality assurance

3. **Maintain Consistency**
   - Document architectural decisions
   - Share patterns with team members
   - Iterate and improve architectural practices

## üîÑ **Integration with Other Domains**

**With Project Planning:**
- Use project planning to establish initial architecture
- Apply stewardship protocols to maintain architectural vision

**With AI Assistance:**
- Configure AI tools to respect architectural boundaries
- Use AI for pattern analysis and consistency checking
