# Project Planning Prompts

Comprehensive methodologies for creating detailed, actionable project plans using AI-assisted development approaches.

## üìä **Available Prompts**

### [Blueprint Generator](blueprint_generator/)
**Generate comprehensive project plans using AI assistance**

A complete system for transforming project ideas into detailed, executable plans through structured human-AI collaboration.

**Key Features:**
- **Structured template system** - Clear sections for project definition and requirements
- **Expert AI instructions** - Detailed guidance for AI assistants to generate comprehensive plans
- **"Vibecoding" methodology** - Human-AI collaboration patterns for optimal results
- **Real-world examples** - Proven implementations from successful projects

**When to Use:**
- Starting a new software project from scratch
- Need comprehensive technical documentation and roadmaps
- Want structured development methodologies and best practices
- Require detailed architecture and implementation plans

## üéØ **Project Planning Philosophy**

These prompts are built on proven principles:

### **Comprehensive Planning**
- Transform high-level ideas into detailed specifications
- Create structured requirements (Functional, Non-Functional, Technical)
- Develop phase-based roadmaps with clear milestones

### **AI-Human Collaboration**
- Human provides vision and constraints
- AI contributes technical expertise and structured thinking
- Iterative refinement leads to optimal results

### **Actionable Outputs**
- Plans that can be immediately implemented
- Clear technical specifications and architecture diagrams
- Detailed development roadmaps with specific tasks

## üöÄ **Getting Started with Project Planning**

1. **Define Your Project**
   - Use the Blueprint Generator template
   - Fill out project vision, goals, and key features
   - Specify technology preferences and constraints

2. **Generate Your Plan**
   - Provide the completed template to an AI assistant
   - Review the generated comprehensive plan
   - Iterate and refine based on your specific needs

3. **Execute with Structure**
   - Follow the generated development roadmap
   - Use the architectural guidance for implementation
   - Apply the collaboration rules for ongoing development

## üîó **Methodology Integration**

**Blueprint Generator creates plans that include:**
- **Technical Architecture** - System design and technology stack decisions
- **Development Methodology** - "Vibecoding" collaboration patterns
- **Quality Assurance** - Testing strategies and security considerations
- **AI Collaboration Rules** - Integration guidance for development tools

## üîÑ **Integration with Other Domains**

**With Architecture:**
- Generated plans provide architectural frameworks
- Use Architecture/Stewardship Protocol to maintain plan integrity during development

**With AI Assistance:**
- Plans include specific AI collaboration rules
- Configure AI tools based on project-specific methodologies

## ü§ù **Contributing Project Planning Prompts**

We welcome contributions in:
- **Agile methodology templates** (coming soon)
- **DevOps integration frameworks** (coming soon)
- **Testing strategy generators** (coming soon)
- **Documentation automation** (coming soon)

## üí° **Success Patterns**

Effective project planning with these prompts:
- **Start comprehensive, iterate quickly** - Generate complete plans, then refine
- **Balance detail with flexibility** - Detailed enough to execute, flexible enough to adapt
- **Document methodology decisions** - Capture reasoning for future reference
