# Prompt Craft - Prompts Collection

A comprehensive collection of high-quality prompts for AI-assisted software development, organized by domain for maximum discoverability and scalability.

## 🗂️ **Organization by Domain**

This collection is organized by **problem domain** to help you quickly find the right prompts for your specific needs:

### 🛠️ [Development](development/)
**Software development workflow prompts**
- **[Architecture](development/architecture/)** - System design and architectural guidance
- **[Project Planning](development/project_planning/)** - Comprehensive project planning methodologies

### 🤖 [AI Assistance](ai_assistance/)
**Tool-specific configuration and rules**
- **[Cursor](ai_assistance/cursor/)** - IDE integration and coding assistant rules

## 🚀 **Quick Navigation**

### **By Use Case:**
- **Starting a new project?** → [Development/Project Planning](development/project_planning/)
- **Need architectural guidance?** → [Development/Architecture](development/architecture/)
- **Setting up AI coding tools?** → [AI Assistance](ai_assistance/)

### **By Tool:**
- **Cursor IDE** → [AI Assistance/Cursor](ai_assistance/cursor/)
- **General Development** → [Development](development/)

## 📋 **What Each Domain Contains**

Each domain follows a consistent structure:
- **Templates** - Ready-to-use prompt templates
- **Examples** - Real-world implementations
- **Documentation** - Usage guides and best practices

## 🔍 **Finding What You Need**

1. **Browse by Domain** - Start with the domain that matches your current task
2. **Check README files** - Each directory has detailed documentation
3. **Follow the examples** - Real-world examples show you exactly how to use each prompt

## 🤝 **Contributing New Prompts**

Want to add a new prompt? Check our [contribution templates](../templates/) and [contribution guide](../docs/contribution_guide.md) for standardized patterns that make it easy to add high-quality content.

## 🎯 **Design Philosophy**

This organization prioritizes:
- **Domain-first discovery** - Find prompts by the problem you're solving
- **Scalable taxonomy** - Works whether we have 10 or 1000 prompts
- **Clear boundaries** - Each domain has distinct, non-overlapping concerns
- **Consistent patterns** - Same structure across all domains for predictability

*This structure is designed to grow with the community. As new domains emerge, they can be easily added while maintaining the same intuitive organization principles.*
